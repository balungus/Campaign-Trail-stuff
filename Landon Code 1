Lyndon Johnson has declared he will not serve another term after a poor primary performance, leaving his successor Hubert Humphrey to pick up the pieces.</br><br>Republicans are as divided as ever following the 1968 primaries when, against all odds and rejecting conventional wisdom, Alf Landon had won the nomination. This strange episode in party politics has morphed the Humphrey campaign from one of hopeless optimism to reasonable confidence in their chances, despite the rumblings in Dixie from George Wallace.</br><br>Americans fed up with the Johnson administration are wincing at how the election is shaping up, and are presented with two alternatives, neither of which are especially appealing, albeit for vastly differing reasons. Can Landon unite his party and take back the White House?

His experience in politics begins and ends at being a two-term Kansan governor in the mid-30's, and he has now returned to the political spotlight 32 years after his devastating loss. His return to public prominence is mainly due to his speaking tours on college campuses, dubbed \"Landon Lectures\", endearing him to the youth, who were his biggest demographic in his primary campaign.</br><br>Landon, when running in 1936, was known as something of a fiscal conservative, despite his campaign tepidly focusing on maintaining the New Deal. His vocal support of Johnson's Great Society will rankle many in his party, unless he is able to effectively thread the needle on the matter. Moderate to liberal on social policy, it's unlikely he would be able to compete with Wallace in the South. Along with this, he must soothe concerns regarding not only the long gap in his political resume, but his age as well, as he would be 81 years old by election day.
